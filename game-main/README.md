# Maze Game

A game about university life, made using [libGDX](https://libgdx.com/).

## How to run

This project uses [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) to manage dependencies.

On Windows, run `gradlew.bat` in command prompt; on Linux, run `./gradlew`
or use Gradle installed from a package manager.

After the Gradle command, add one of these arguments:

- `run`: compiles everything and starts the game.
- `jar`: compiles everything and creates an executable JAR file, which can be
  found in the folder `lwjgl3/build/libs`. This file must be uploaded to the
  team website and submitted for the assessment.
- `test`: runs automated tests.
